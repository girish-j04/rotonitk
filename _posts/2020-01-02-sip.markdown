title: Social Initiative Projects (SIPs)
subtitle: Making a Change
description: "Social Initiative Project (or SIP) is an initiative taken up by the club to highlight societal concerns and spread awareness about them through a series of events and online posts. This is a collaborative effort of all the members of the club which includes research, content creation, publicity and marketing among others. We frequently tie-up with other like-minded people and organisations to maximize our outreach. The SIPs are where we collectively work towards a common goal whilst strengthening our inter-personal skills."

- title: Reject Draft EIA Notification 2020
  description: "The EIA has always banked on public opinion as one of the criterias to evaluate a project before awarding it an 'Environmental clearance' or a go-ahead signal. But the Draft of 2020 is formulated to change that. What the draft, ultimately, seeks to do is expand the list of projects that don’t require public consultations before receiving a prior environmental clearance allowing them to commence operations. This move could destroy life and environment at an exponential rate. To stop this from happening, we spread the word and circulated the petition to Reject E.I.A. We had a live session with the famous law student Sonali Jain who helped us get a more clear idea about the legal aspect of this issue. ISTE NITK joined us in our last leg of the project, the video publicity."

- title: PRIDE Month
  description: "As men and women of conscience, we reject discrimination in general but due to lack of education and awareness and also due to cultural attitudes people refrain from acknowledging the discrimation against the LGBTQIA+ community. This preconceived notion is the main cause of oppression in the LGBTQIA+ community and we can put an end to this only by removing the stigma and educating the society about the partisanship about the community. So this month’s SIP was dedicated to spreading awareness about the LGBTQIA+ community."

- title: Cyclone Amphan
  description: "On the 25th of May, a deadly cyclone named Amphan (pronounced as UM-PUN) made landfall in West Bengal and caused severe damage to Kolkata, Howrah and several other nearby areas. About 500,000 people had been evacuated to shelters by the state administration. South Asia has emerged as a global hotspot for disaster displacement in recent times. Seventeen teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had been deployed in Odisha and West Bengal in view of the approaching cyclone. But this atrocity did not receive enough media coverage. So we took it upon ourselves to spread the word. We also raised funds for Quarantined Student Youth Network, Kolkata."

By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water stressed"
