description: "Our Biggest production every year is the Annual Charity Play, all proceeds from which go towards supporting a charitable cause.It has grown to become the flagship event of our collegiate club, with attendees including Mangalore audience, NITK Alumni, Faculty, Students from NITK and neighbouring colleges.

Door to door donations are collected and ticket sales are made.The proceeds usually go to places like Snehadeep Orphanage, Riya Foundation and to the KREC Kannada medium school. Donors could choose the cause they wanted to contribute to. Snehadeep Orphanage is an orphanage in Mangalore which houses twenty one HIV positive children and gives them accommodation as well as looks after all their needs. Riya Foundation is a mental health institution that looks after mentally challenged people and provides them education and boarding. The play engaged the audience right till the end of the show and it received a positive response from the audience."
